# RGBColorGame
A RGB game to test your RGB skills. One of my proudest games so far, I made this in my first month of learning Web Development.
Rules are simple, there is a RGB code in the header and you will have to guess out of the random colors which one is the color displayed in the header.
There are 3 difficulty modes, a score keeper and other functionalities.
